# terraform-workflows
- Create different types of terraform workflows
- Create a token resource (refer to sample-tok.tf) in the tf config directory to authenticate with Databricks
- Create a git credentials resource (refer to sample-git-credentials) to provision git credentials for the user. No need to provision this resource repeatedly unless the git token has changed/expired.
